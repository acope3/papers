Previous work has shown that laboratory estimates of selection can improve model fit but did not assess their adequacy.
We assess the adequacy of experimentally inferred site specific selection using DMS to inform phylogenetic models.

\section*{Introduction}

Incorporation of selection into phylogenetic frameworks has been a long lasting endeavor.
Early models focused on the influence of selection on the substitution rate between a resident and a mutant \citep{GoldmanAndYang1994, MuseAndGaut1994, thorne1996}.
These models however, lack site specific equilibrium frequencies.
The importance of site specific equilibrium frequencies has long been noted \citep{felsenstein1981, gojobori1983}.
\citet{HalpernAndBruno1998} first introduced a framework to incorporate site specific equilibrium frequencies of amino acids.
However, they had to concede that their model was to parameter rich and therefore intractable for biological data sets without simplifying assumptions.
More recent models incorporating site specific equilibrium frequencies still require a large number of parameter to be estimated from the sequence data \citep{LartillotAndPhilippe2004,le2008,wang2008,holder2008,wu2013,tamuri2014}.
Other approaches treat site specific selection as a random effect \citep{rodrigue2010,rodrigue2013,rodrigue2014}.
A full parameterization of site specific equilibrium for amino acids requires $19\times L$ parameters were $L$ is the length of the sequence.
It therefore is an attractive option to utilize laboratory experiments to empirically estimate site specific selection on amino acids and infer their equilibrium frequencies \citep{bloom2014, thyagarajan2014, bloom2017}.

Deep mutation scanning (DMS) is often used to generate comprehensive fitness estimates of proteins \citep{Fowler2014}.
The ability to estimate site specific selection on amino acids as it allows to estimte amino acid preferences and the genetic load a mutation would introduce \citep{bloom2014,firnberg2014,stiffler2016}.
The quality of empirical estimates of site specific selection on amino acids from DMS depends on many factors, e.g. the initial library of mutants and the applied selection pressure.

Incorporating empirical estimates of site specific selection on amino acids has important features.
Individual amino acid site along the protein show differences in evolutionary rates, and strong preferences for amino acids \citep{HalpernAndBruno1998, ashenberg2013, echave2016}
The usage of site specific selection acknowledges the heterogeneity in selection along the protein sequence \citep{hilton2017}.
It reduces the number of parameters that have to be estimated from the data, making it applicable for smaller data sets and allowing for more complex models.
The incorporation of empirical estimates of selection does also have shortcomings.
Estimates of selection can only be obtained for fast growing organisms that can be manipulated under laboratory conditions and for proteins for which a suitable selection pressure can be applied.
This is a severe limitation of experimentally informed models as many organism can not be cultivated under laboratory conditions or have a to long generation time.

Even in the cases were empirical estimates of site specific selection on amino acids can be obtained, their applicability for phylogenetic reconstruction is not yet fully clear.
In this study, we assess the adequacy of experimentally inferred site specific selection using DMS to inform phylogenetic models.
We use site specific estimates of selection on amino acids for the $\beta$-lactamase TEM from \citet{stiffler2016}.
We find that experimentally inferred selection, while improving model fit, does not adequately reflect evolution in the wild.
In contrast, \selac \citep{beaulieu2018} a mechanistic phylogenetic model of stabilizing selection rooted in first principles with site specific equilibrium frequencies improves model fit, and better reflects evolution in the wild.
\selac assumes that the distance of two amino acids in \PC space affects substitution probabilities and estimates only one discrete parameter per site, the optimal amino acid at a site.
This reduces the number of parameters to $L$ site specific parameters instead of $19\times L$.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Site Specific Stabilizing Selection on Amino Acids Improves Model Fit}
We compared the models \phydms \citep{hilton2017} and \selac, models of stabilizing site specific amino acid selection, to 281 other codon and nucleotide models.
We fitted all models to 49 sequences of the $\beta$-lactamase TEM.
Models with site specific selection on amino acids improved model fits by 917 to 1483 AICc units over codon or nucleotide models without site specific selection (Table \ref{tab:AIC}).
In addition, \selac does outperform the experimentally informed model \phydms by 560 to  566 AICc units.

\selac utilizes a hierarchical model framework and estimates 263 site specific parameters, $\sim5\%$ of the $19\times L = 4997$ parameters necessary to fully describe the site specific selection on amino acids.
In contrast, \phydms does not infer any site specific parameters, but utilizes site specific selection on amino acids estimated from deep mutation scanning experiments.
Incorporating site specific selection on amino acids estimated from deep mutation scanning experiments into \selac (\selac+DMS) yields a similar AICc value to \selac without that information.
However, \selac+DMS is favored by AICc.
This is solely due to a decrease in the number of parameters estimated, as the $\log(\Lik)$ worsens from $-1498$ to $-1768$ (Table \ref{tab:AIC}).
The number of parameter for \selac, however, is reported conservatively as the number of unique site patterns in the TEM alignment is only 27 which would yield a total number of parameters of $123$.
This however is likely an under estimate of the degrees of freedom and the true number of parameters remains unclear at this point due to the inherent non-independence of the underlying data.

	\label{fig:phylo}
\end{figure}

The best codon model (\gy) \citep{GoldmanAndYang1994} is outperformed by several nucleotide model e.g. \emph{SYM} \citep{zharkikh1994}.
This could be an indication that negative frequency dependent selection like it is modeled in \gy is not appropriate for TEM \citep{GoldmanAndYang1994,beaulieu2018}.
Figure \ref{fig:phylo} shows that the estimated phylogenetic trees shift from long terminal branches (\selac) to longer internal branches (\phydms).
All models produce polytomies but their location differs along the phylogeny between models.
The largest polytomies appear in the experimentally informed phylogenies.
The position of the sequences with the longest branches changes between the \selac model fit and the \phydms and \gy model fit were \gy shows partial agreement with \selac.
The \selac model is currently to slow to estimate the topology, therefore the topology was estimated using the codon model of \citet{KosiolEtAl07}.
At this point it is therefore unclear if the difference in topology can be attributes to the experimentally inferred selection on amino acids.

\subsection*{Laboratory Inferences of Selection are inconsistent with Observed Sequences.}
Improved model fits with phydms are deceiving.
The site specific selection inferred by the deep mutation scanning experiment is inconsistent with the observed TEM sequences.
We find that the sequence of selectively favored amino acids has only $52 \%$ sequence similarity with the observed consensus sequence (Figure \ref{fig:sim_seqs_cons}).
This is in contrast to the $99 \%$ of sequence similarity with the sequence of selectively favored amino acids estimated by \selac.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Every 5th residue of TEM. DMS and simulation based on DMS do not reflect natural sequences. TODO: full alignemnt? at least adjust names and numbering}
	\label{fig:sim_seqs_cons}
\end{figure}

Simulations of codon sequences under the experimentally inferred site specific selection for amino acids reveals that we would not expect to see the observed TEM sequences.
We simulated under a wide range of effective population sizes $N_e$, and find that the experimentally inferred site specific selection is very strong.
Only when $N_e$ is reduced to one individual drift is overpowering the efficacy of selection.
With realistic values for $N_e = 10^7$, we find that the simulated sequences to show sequence similarity of $62 \%$ with the observed consensus sequence (Figure \ref{fig:dms_sim}a).
This is a higher similarity than the observed consensus sequence shows with the sequence of selectively favored amino acids estimated using deep mutation scanning.
The genetic load of the simulated sequences decrease slowly with increasing $N_e$ (Figure \ref{fig:dms_sim}b).
At time 1 and $N_e = 10^7$ the simulated sequences show a genetic load of 0.25, which is in contrast to the $\sim 8$ times higher observed load of $2.1$.
Thus it appears unlikely that the observed sequences have evolved under the experimentally inferred site specific selection for amino acids.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Stabilizing Selection for Optimal Physicochemical Probabilities Increases Model Adequacy} 
We assessed model adequacy of \selac and find that \selac better explains the observed TEM sequences.
The observed consensus sequence has a very high sequence similarity with the sequence of selectively favored amino acids estimated by \selac ($99 \%$).
Furthermore, assuming the site specific selection estimated by \selac, the observed sequences show a small nonzero genetic load (Table \ref{tab:selection}, Figure \ref{fig:tem2016_sse}).

We simulated codon sequences forward in time for various length of time to assess the sequence similarity, assuming the \selac inferred site specific selection for amino acids.
% Ancestral starting point
We simulated the evolution of TEM from the inferred ancestral state using a wide range of effective population sizes $N_e$ (Figure \ref{fig:selac_sim}a).
The ancestral state was estimated to be the observed consensus sequence.
For small $N_e$, we find that sequences drift away from the observed consensus. 
In turn, the genetic load increases drastically.
With increasing $N_e = 10^7$ the simulated sequences reach a sequence similarity at time 1 of $83 \%$, this is in contrast to the observed sequence similarity $98 \%$.
We calculated the genetic load at this time of the simulated sequences to be $9.8\times10^{-6}$ (Figure \ref{fig:selac_sim}b).
The genetic load of the observed sequences is estimated $4.2\times 10^{-5}$, one order of magnitude higher.
Thus, the simulated sequences show a lower genetic load despite the greater divergence from the observed consensus sequence.

    \label{fig:selac_sim}
\end{figure}

% Random starting point
To further demonstrate the consistency of \selac, we simulated codon sequences over the same period of time using $10$ random codon sequences.
We find that the sequence similarity increases with effective population size $N_e$.
The random sequences start of with a similarity of $\sim6 \%$ which increases with $N_e$ to $\sim28 \%$ (Figure \ref{fig:selac_sim_rand}a).
The same initial sequences under the site specific selection inferred by the deep mutation scanning experiment increase only to $\sim18 \%$ in sequence similarity.



\subsection*{Site Specific estimates of Selection on Amino Acids}
\selac allows for the estimation ofsite specific selection on amino acids and the genetic load of an observed amino acid relative to the inferred optimal amino acid.
We find that the genetic load is distributed along most of the observed TEM sequence with the exception of the region between residue 80 to 120 were three consecutive helices are located (Figure \ref{fig:tem2016_sse}). 
The most noticeable increases in genetic load are found in unstructured regions
The largest increase in genetic load however, is located at the beginning of the last helix.
We therefore estimate similar genetic loads for helices and unstructured regions in the observed TEM sequences (Table \ref{tab:selection}).
The highest efficacy of selection $G$ and the lowest genetic load among the TEM secondary structure features is estimated in the beta sheet regions.
The Active sites appear to be under the strongest selection, with no accumulated genetic load.
This is in concordance with the experimental estimates.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{llrrrr}
    & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{G} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Genetic Load} \\ 
    Protein & Secondary Structure	& \multicolumn{1}{c}{Mean} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{SE} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Mean} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{SE} \\ \hline 
    TEM	&		& 219.3 & 7.5  & $15.9\times10^{-8}$ & $6.5\times10^{-8}$ \\
    &Helix 		& 206.1 & 12.4 & $17.5\times10^{-8}$ & $13.1\times10^{-8}$ \\

    &Unstructured 	& 224.8 & 11.4 & $18.6\times10^{-8}$ & $8.1\times10^{-8}$ \\

    SHV&		& 244.9 & 6.8  & $4.0\times10^{-8}$ & $1.9\times10^{-8}$ \\
    &Helix		& 234.6 & 11.5 & $7.3\times10^{-8}$ & $4.8\times10^{-8}$ \\
    &Beta Sheet 	& 253.1 & 12.8 & $2.1\times10^{-8}$ & $1.1\times10^{-8}$ \\
    &Unstructured	& 250.3 & 11.0 & $1.8\times10^{-8}$ & $58.7\times10^{-8}$  \\
    &Active Sites	& 199.9 & 100  & $2.4\times10^{-8}$ & $2.4\times10^{-8}$ \\

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Efficacy of selection (G) and Genetic Load for TEM and SHV and separated by secondary structure.}
  \label{tab:selection}
\end{table}

It was previously proposed that experimentally inferred site specific selection for amino acids can be used to extrapolate the fitness landscape of related proteins \citep{bloom2014, bloom2017}.
We therefore compared the site specific efficacy of selection G, the \selac selection parameters of our \selac TEM model fit to a \selac model fit of SHV, genetic load.
We find that site specific efficacy of selection $G$ differs greatly between SHV and TEM ($\rho = 0.12$), despite a similar estimate of the parameter $\alpha_G$ describing the distribution of $G$ values (Figure \ref{fig:tem_shv_param_comp}a).
We generally find increased G values in SHV, with the exception of the active site (Table \ref{tab:selection}).
However, most \selac selection parameters are very similar between the TEM and the SHV model fit. 
An exception is the weight for the \PC composition property $\alpha_c$ (Figure \ref{fig:tem_shv_param_comp}b).

The genetic load in SHV is by an order of magnitude lower than in TEM with the exception of residues found in $\beta$-sheets and the active site (Table \ref{tab:selection}).
This is consistent with the elevated site specific efficacy of selection G in SHV.
As a comparison of site specific efficacy of selection G already indicated, the sites introducing genetic load differ between SHV and TEM (Figure \ref{fig:shv2016_sse}).
In contrast to TEM, we find the highest genetic load in SHV secondary structure features in the helices (Table \ref{tab:selection}).
We find the highest genetic load in SHV at the end of the first helix.
However, we do find a peak of similar magnitude in the TEM sequence at the end of the first helix.

\section*{Discussion}

Here we revisited how well experimental selection estimates from laboratory experiments, specifically deep mutation scanning, explain sequence evolution and compared it to \selac, a novel phylogenetic framework.
Previous work has shown that laboratory estimates of selection can improve model fit over classical approaches like GY94 \citep{bloom2014, bloom2017}.
While our study confirms this notion, we identify important shortcomings of these laboratory estimates.
In contrast, \selac is a more general phylogenetic model of stabilizing selection that does not depend on costly laboratory estimates of selection and is favored by model selection (Table \ref{tab:AIC}).

While previous work showed the advantages of experimentally informed phylogenetics estimates, they did not assess how adequate the estimated selection reflects observed sequences.
This becomes evident in the low sequence similarity between the observed consensus sequence and the sequence of selectively favored amino acids estimated from deep mutation scanning experiments.
This begs the question how well the experimental selection coefficients represent evolution in the wild.
Deep mutation scanning experiments are performed using a comprehensive library of mutants and a strong artificial selection pressure \citep{FirnbergAndOstermeier2012, Jain2014, FowlerAndFields2014, Fowler2014}.
This results in a very large selection coefficient $s$ and a heterogeneous population of competing individuals like it is unlikey to occur in the wild.

The induced selection pressure during the deep mutation scanning experiment was limited to ampicillin \citep{stiffler2016} and focused on the TEM-1 variant.
However, TEM variants can also confer resistance to a wide range of other antibiotics, like other penicillins, cephalosporins, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or aztreonam \citep{sougakoff1988,sougakoff1989,goussard1991,mabilat1992,chanal1992,brun1994}.
Thus, the inferred selection is biased towards ampicillin and as our simulations show does not reflect the evolution the observed TEM variants have experienced (Figure \ref{fig:dms_sim}).
This may very well be very appropriate to explore the selection on TEM in a modern hospital environment but is unlikely to be representative of the selection faced in the wild.
%We therefore propose to include a variety of selection pressures if the experimental selection estimates are used for phylogenetic inference.

%TODO:  Lack of repeatability between labs introduces further problems (Firnberg et al 2014 vs. Stifler et al. 2016).

If we assume that the experimental selection estimates underly the evolution of the observed TEM sequences we are left with two possible explanations for the observed sequences.
First, the sequences are unable to reach a fitness peak, potentially due to a lack of selection, or not enough time.
Second, the observed TEM sequences are maladapted.
Both options seem unlikely.
\ecoli has a large effective population size $N_e$, estimates are on the order of $10^8$ to $10^9$ \citep{OchmanAndWilson1987, hartl1994}.
As new mutations are introduced into a population proportional to $N_e$, \ecoli can effectively explore the sequence space.
We therefore expect the observed sequence variants to be near mutation-selection-drift equilibrium.
This is confirmed by our simulations as we would expect to observe a higher sequence similarity and decreased genetic load even with much smaller $N_e$ (Figure \ref{fig:dms_sim}).
Furthermore, previous work showed that the catalytic reaction performed by TEM of penicillin-class antibiotics is close the diffusion limit, making TEM a so-called perfect enzyme \citep{matagne1998}.

As experimental selection estimates are not readily available, one solution is to extrapolate the estimates to homologous gene families \citep{bloom2014, bloom2017}.
When extrapolating the selection estimates from the $\beta$-lactamase family TEM to the SHV family, the sequence similarity between the observed consensus sequence and the sequence of selectively favored amino acids estimated from deep mutation scanning experiments drops from $52 \% $ to $49 \%$.
Comparison of the site specific efficacy of selection (G) revealed large differences in the site specific selection on amino acids between TEM and SHV.
The mismatched in \PC weights also indicates differences in selection constrains. 
While the polarity of amino acids is of similar importance in TEM and SHV, amino acid composition plays a much greater role in SHV than in TEM.

In contrast to the experimental selection estimates, the \selac selection estimates are consistent with the observed sequences, e.g. the selectively favored amino acids estimated by \selac shows a high sequence similarity with the observed consensus sequence ($99 \%$).
\selac does not rely on artificially induced selection in the laboratory but is a mechanistic framework rooted in first principles.
It estimates site specific selection on amino acids from the sequence data based on distances between amino acids in \PC space \citep{grantham1974,beaulieu2018}.
This allows \selac to be applied to any set of protein coding sequences, eliminating the need to extrapolate from one homologous gene family to the next (e.g. from TEM to SHV).

While \selac better explains the observed TEM sequences than the experimental estimates of site specific selection on amino acids, it is not without shortcomings itself.
\selac is currently to slow to be used in topology searches, therefore it is unclear if the differences in topology between \phydms and \selac can be attributed to the same inadequacsies of experimentally inferred selection.
As the simulation of TEM evolution from he ancestral state under the \selac inferred site specific selection reveald, the formulation of \selac can and should be improved upon.
While \selac allows for site heterogeneity in selection for amino acids, it still assumes multiplicative fitness across all sites and therefore ignores epistatis.
This however, is a shortcoming shared with experimental estimates by deep mutation scanning, as each mutation typically only carries one mutation \citep{FirnbergAndOstermeier2012, Jain2014}.
\selac is a model stabilizing selection, however, not every protein is under stabilizing selection.
TEM plays a role in chemical warfare with conspecifics and other microbes, therefore some sites may be under negative frequency dependent selection.
This potential heterogeneity in selection highlights another shortcoming of \selac.
\selac assumes the same distribution for the efficacy of selection (G) across the whole proteins.
However, it is easy to imagine that sites in different secondary structures or at active sites do not share a common distribution.

% TODO: talk about that random sequences still have 30% functionallity under selac. Could explain why the  simulation from the ancestral state diverges to ~80 %. Or maybe do we underestimate selection?

As \selac assumes that the fitness of an amino acid at a site declines with its distance in \PC space to the optimal amino acid, the choice of \PC properties becomes important.
In this study, we assumed the \PC properties estimated by \citet{grantham1974} for all sites.
However, a wide range of \PC properties of amino acids have been assessed.
A more optimal choice of \PC properties may be possible as well as the a relaxation of the assumptions that the same properties apply to all sites equally.
The hierarchical model structure allows to easily address these shortcoming as needed.

In conclusion, experimental estimates of site specific selection on amino acids have to be treated with great care and their adequacy should be assessed before informing phylogenetic studies.
This study was initiated to assess the quality of \selac with the expectation that \selac could be a faster, cheaper, and more readily available alternative to experimentally inferred seletion.
Specifically in organisms were these experiments are not feasible (e.g. whales).
It makes intuitive sense that fitness meassured in living organisms of mutations would provide more information on the evolution of proteins than a model relying on many simplifying assumptions.
As we show in this study, not only can we estimate site specific selection on amino acids but it appears that our approach is more reliable than experimental estimates of selection on amino acids.


\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Phylogenetic Inference and Model selection}

TEM and SHV sequences were obtained from \citet{bloom2017} already aligned.
We however, separated the TEM and SHV sequences into individual alignments.
Experimentally fitness values for TEM were taken from \citet{stiffler2016}.
We followed \citep{bloom2017} to convert the experimental fitness values into site specific equilibrium frequencies for \phydms. 
\phydms (version 2.5.1) was fitted using site specific selection on amino acids estimated from deep mutation scanning experiments from \citet{stiffler2016} and python (version 3.6).

\selac (version 1.6.1) was fitted to the TEM alignment using R (version 3.4.1) \citep{rcore} with and without site specific selection on amino acids estimated from deep mutation scanning experiments.
We assumed the \PC properties estimated by \citet{grantham1974}.
We chose the contraint free  general unrestricted model \citep{yang1994} as mutation model .
All other models were fitted using IQTree \citep{nguyen2015}.

We report each model's $\log(\Lik)$, AIC, and  AICc. 
Models were selected based on the AICc values.

\subsection*{Sequence Simulation}

Sequences were simulated by stochastic simulations using a Gillespie algorithm \citep{gillespie1976} that was model independent.
The simulation followed \citet{SellaAndHirsh2005} to calculate fixation probabilities.
The fitness values were estimated using \selac or experimentally inferred.
We chose the fitness values of the highest concentration (2500 $\mu g/mL$) treatment of ampicillin for our comparison.
We modified the experimental fitness such that the amino acid with the highest fitness at each site has a value of one.
Mutation rates were taken from the \selac or \selac+DMS fit.
The initial sequences were either a random sample of 263 codons or the ancestral sequence reconstructed using FastML \citep{fastml} (last accessed: 30.09.2018).
Each sequence was simulated 10 times and we report average genetic load and sequence similarity and the corresponding standard error.
The sequences were sampled at times 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 expected mutations per site.

\subsection*{Estimating site specific efficacy of selection G}

\selac does not by default estimate site specific values for $G$ but assusmes G values follow a gamma distribution \citep{Felsenstein2001}.
Site specific values for $G$ were optimized by fixing all estimated parameters and perfoming a maximum likelihood search without the usual integration over $G$.
In contrast to \selac that assumes $G$ to be purley positive, we allowed negative values for $G$ and constrait the search to values between $-300$ and $300$.

\subsection*{Estimating site specific fitness values $w_i$}

Following \citet{beaulieu2018} $w_i$ is proportional to
\begin{equation}
w_i \propto \exp(-A_0\eta\psi)
\end{equation}
were $A_0$ describes the decline in fitness with each high energy phosphate bond wasted per unit time, and $\psi$ is the protein's production rate.
$\eta$ is the cost/benefit ratio of a protein (see \citep{beaulieu2018} for details). 
However, \selac only estimates a composition parameter $\psi' = A_0\psi N_e$.
$N_e$ describes the effective population size.
\selac assumes $N_e = 5\times 10^6$.
\selac assumes $A_0 = 4 \times 10{-7}$ \citep{gilchrist2007}.
Thus, 
\begin{equation}
\psi = \frac{\psi'}{A_0N_eq}
\end{equation}


\subsection*{Model Adequacy}

Model adequacy was assessed by comparing the observed sequences and simulations under the site specific selection inferred by the deep mutation scanning experiment or \selac.
First, similarity between the sequence of selectively favored amino acids and the observed TEM sequences was assessed.
Sequence similarity was measured as the number of differences in the amino acid sequence.
Second, the genetic load of the observed and the simulated sequences was calculated using either the site specific selection inferred by the deep mutation scanning experiment or \selac.

Genetic load was calculated as
\begin{equation}
L_i = \frac{w_{max} - w_i}{w_{max}}
\end{equation}
were $w_{max}$ is the fitness of the sequence of selectively favored amino acids estimated using  the site specific selection inferred by the deep mutation scanning experiment or \selac.
$w_i$ represents the fitness of the $i$th residue.
This the genetic load $L$ of a sequence is given by $\sum_{i=1}^n L_i$ where $n$ is the number of amino acids.
