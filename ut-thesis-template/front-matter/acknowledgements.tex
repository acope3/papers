\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I am greatly indebted to many folks who have directly and indirectly aided my growth both as a person and a scientist during my stay at the University of Tennessee.
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to my advisor Mike Gilchrist.
He has influenced my approach to science more than anyone else.
He is to be thanked for elevating my sense of caution and skepticism and rubbing off a bit of his quest for perfection in all he does.
It would be an understatement to say that without Mike's push for focus I would have been lost by working on a myriad of things while completing nothing.
%I also thank him for his immense patience with me and his willingness to go 

A special thanks to Jim Fordyce for infecting me with his insatiable passion for science.
I have learnt a lot over beers with him than any class I have ever taken.
He has been a constant source of inspiration both personally and scientifically.

I would also like to thank my committee members Lou Gross, Sergey Gavrilets and Russ Zaretzki for their support over the years.
A special thanks to all the members of the GiGaOm and HOFF lab groups, especially Graham and Matt for introducing me to the slimy yet beautiful world of salamanders and snakes.
I am also grateful for the generous financial support offered by the EEB department and NIMBioS, which not only helped support my research but also allowed me to present my research to wide audiences and make important personal connections.
My stay in Knoxville couldn't have been made more enjoyable without the social and cultural support offered by Manthan (Indian Student Organization).

My philosophy on science and life has been greatly influenced by Arjun Krishnan and RS Prasanna.
Arjun has been the perennial sounding board for all my ideas and immensely helpful in sorting out the good ones from the rest.
His constant push for justification of every last detail has been invaluable in bringing clarity to my own ideas. 

At last, but more important than all, this work wouldn't have been possible without the unfailing love and affection of Samhita.
She has been a pillar of strength during my bad times and has kept me grounded during the good ones.
Her dedication to science and work has been greatly inspirational and influential.
