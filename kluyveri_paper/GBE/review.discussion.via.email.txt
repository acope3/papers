Here is a link with the Reviewer comments and my notes aboutthem.https://docs.google.com/document/d/155QZfBfkR-FI3Hi6rjhX37hqu5n5gubITPm7LU

I also attached an updated manuscript and pushed the changes to the repository.
Let me know once you have agreed on attempting to resubmit or sending it
somewhere else.

      Thanks. These reviews are really positive overall (maybe I'm just
      used to SystBio reviews, which are savage). I agree with you both
      that incorporating R2's comments will make the paper stronger. I'd
      lean towards submitting somewhere else for the revision -- the EIC
      didn't say don't send it back, but didn't say maybe we'll look at a
      revision, either.
Best,
Brian

      Hi Mike, I am not at all dismissing R2's comments, I have
      already started addressing some of R2's criticisms.
If you think we could rebottle some of the criticism I would
appreciate some help crafting such a letter. I was already thinking
about other journals, like Evolution maybe.

I will get back to you as soon as I can with an updated version and
an outline of R2's criticisms.
Let me know if there are any comments in the mean time.

      Hi,

      While this is disappointing news, the reviews, overall,
      are positive and
      support the idea that this is an interesting topic worth
      studying.  Nice
      work!

      Don't be too quick to dismiss Reviewer 2's criticisms. 
      They indicate ze
      is very familiar with this topic area and point out
      holes (some valid,
      some invalid) in our argument that should be addressed. 
      It is not clear
      to me if addressing them would require any substantial
      new analyses,
      perhaps just clearer arguments.

      After taking care of the simple fixes, I think the
      wisest step would be
      to create an outline of R2's arguments and begin
      crafting a response. 
      Although they did not invite a resubmission, if you can
      succinctly and
      quickly rebutt R2's main criticisms in a letter and the
      manuscript, you
      could ask that it be considered for re-reviewed.

      C-left is the left portion of chromosome C, accounting
      for approximately 1 Mbp (400 genes) of the
      > 12 Mbp L. kluyveri genome. C-left was first described

      much higher than in the rest of the genome (53% vs 40%),
      it lacks transposable elements (Payen et
      > al. 2009, cited), it does not recombine in laboratory
      crosses (Brion et al. 2017, PMID 28763437, not cited),
      it appears to be an introgression from
      > another species (Payen et al. 2009; Friedrich et al
      2015, cited), and it is only present in Lachancea
      kluyveri, not other Lachancea species (Vakirlis
      > et al. 2016, PMID 27247244, not cited). C-left is
