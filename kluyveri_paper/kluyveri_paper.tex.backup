\begin{abstract}
Codon usage bias (CUB), the differential non-uniform usage of synonymous codons, can vary greatly between genes within an organism and across organisms due to mutation bias or selective constrains. 
Large efforts have been made to develope and explore models to understand intra-genomic variation in codon usage and the contributions of mutation and selection to its evolution.
Comparative studies have been undertaken to further our understanding of variation in codon usage between species.
However, limited efforts have been made to understand how CUB is effected, and in return effects hybridization or introgression events between species with potentially large differences in CUB. 
In this study, we explore the signature of CUB in \textit{Lachancea kluyveri}, a yeast that has experienced a large introgression covering the whole left arm of chromosome C and affecting about 10\% of all genes.
The introgression event found in the \kluyveri genome make this yeast an ideal candidate to explore intra and inter-genomic differences in CUB.
The \kluyveri genome provides insights about the adaptation of introgressed regions to the novel genomic host environment, with potentially large differences in selection due to shifts in selective constraints like tRNA availability, the effectiveness of selection due to a change in effective population size, or differences in mutation bias.
We analyzed patterns of codon usage across the \kluyveri genome and separated the effects of mutation bias and selection for translation efficiency on CUB.
The results were compared to the effects of mutation and the strength of selection in the native genome and the introgressed region. 
Our results show distinct patterns of CUB between the introgressed region C-Left and the remaining \kluyveri genome.
In addition we were able to determine that the difference in CUB is mostly driven by differences in mutation bias between C-Left and the remaining genome.
The introgression in the \kluyveri genome is of additional interest as the source organism has not yet been identified.
Given our ability to clearly distinguish codon usage between the introgressed region and the \kluyveri genome we  further explored if CUB is suitable to identify possible candidates for the origin of the introgressed region C-Left.
The estimation of CUB across a variety of yeast species allowed us to identify candidates for the origin of C-Left.
We validated the candidates identified using CUB by comparing GC-content and synteny relationships between C-Left and the candidates.

\section*{Introduction}
%Premise of the work
Organisms undergo phenotypic changes due to selection on fitness relevant traits in their current environment. 
The same principle applies to the genome exposed to its intra-cellular environment showing a specific phenotype.
One phenotype expressed by the genome is its codon composition reflected by codon usage bias (CUB). 
CUB is a fitness relevant trait with respect to the intra-cellular environment reflected by tRNA availability, ribosome pausing time, and translation error rate, effecting how efficient genes can be translated into proteins. 

Proteins with a high expression rate tend to be encoded by genes with a higher frequencies of prefered codons than genes with low expression rates \citep{grantham1981, ikemura1985, sharp1987, sharp1988, wallace2013, gilchrist2015}.
The codon frequency in these highly expressed genes tends to also reflect the available tRNA pool in a cell, matching more abundant tRNA to reduce the time the ribosome has to wait until the correct tRNA is encountered \citep{dong1996, dosreis2004}.
When genomic material is exchanged between organisms by horizontal gene transfer, or hybridazation and introgression events, the exchanged genes experience a novel intra-cellular environment.
In this new environment, the CUB displayed by the transfered genes will adapt to the CUB exhibited by the new host genome. 
A change that is likely faster in genes with high expression rates due to stronger selection on CUB relative to genes with low expression rate mostly affected by mutation bias, evolving more neutral with respect to CUB.

The frequent exchange of genes via horizontal gene transfer can cause organisms to accumulate large quantities of foreign genes (around 17\% in \textit{E. coli} \citep{lawrence1997}).
Genes with an already compatible CUB undergo HGT more frequently and tend to be more likely to fix in a population after transferance \citep{tuller2011}.
Each event of HGT is therefore unlikely to alter the CUB of the genome enough to have a significant effect on the overall fitness of the new host. 
However, in the case of hybridization or introgression event, large quantities of genomic material are embeded in a novel cellular environment possing a potentially large burden on the organism having to express genes with a CUB not reflecting the available tRNA pool.

% The system and why it is relevant for the premise
\textit{Lachancea kluyveri} is the earliest diverging lineage of the known \textit{Lachancea} clade and diverged from the \textit{Saccharomyces} lineage prior to the whole-genome duplication about 100 Mya ago \citep{wolfe1997}. 
\kluyveri has experienced an introgression of about 1Mb at least 19,000 - 150,000 years ago \citep{friedrich2015} making it an ideal candidate to explore intragenomic variation in CUB. 
The introgressed region comprises the whole left arm of chromosome C (C-Left) and shows a difference in average GC-content of \~ 13 \% compared to the rest of the \kluyveri genome.
The origin of the introgressed region is unknown but synteny pattern suggest that a close relative to \kluyveri or all \textit{Lachancea} donated C-Left \citep{payen2009} since synteny regions with C-Left can be found across the \textit{Lachancea} clade.
However, no known \textit{Lachancea} shows a GC-content comparable to C-Left, suggesting that the origin is either an unkown member of the \textit{Lachancea} clade or closely related species.

Patterns of genomic variation help understand evolution, but are mostly explored between and within species and populations.
Here we attempt to separate out intra-genomic variation in mutation and selection driving CUB due to an introgression event in the \kluyveri genome.
The analysis differences in patterns of codon usage allows us to explore the effects of large scale exchange of genomic material. 
We asked if the difference in GC-content observed between C-Left and the rest of the genome is reflected in differences in patterns of codon usage.
Differing codon usage bias in the introgressed region can either be caused by differences in mutation bias, differences in selection for translation efficiency, or both.
In addition we explored the effects of the introgression on the overall CUB in the \kluyveri genome.
We employed a mechanistic model \citep{gilchrist2015} allowing us to distinguish between effects of mutation bias and bias in selection for translation efficiency.
The differential usage of synonymous codons is shaped by differences in nucleotide stability, and selection for translation efficiency and error reduction.
Nucleotide stability varies, and introduces a mutation bias between synonymous codons, prevalent in low expression genes with weak selection for translation efficiency.
In contrast, selection for translation efficiency is strong in highly expressed genes, allowing for the estimation of differences in selection bias between synonymous codons, potentially indicating a shift in the tRNA pool.
Our results indicate that the introgressed region shows a different signature of codon usage bias that can be mostly attributed to differences in mutation bias suggesting that C-Left had experienced a different mutational environment in its original host.
However, differences in mutation bias should persist longer due to the absence of selection and differences in selection bias could have been alleviated since the time of the introgression.   
	
\section*{Results}
The striking difference in GC-content between C-Left and the rest of the \kluyveri genome, indicating differences in the underlying forces shaping nucleotide like mutation bias and selection, make \kluyveri an interessting study organisms. 
The same forces also shape CUB, allowing us to explore potential differences in CUB between regions of the \kluyveri genome.
While CUB has been studied in a variatey of organisms across the tree of life they are often limited to selected model organisms representing various clades.
To our knowledge there have been no studies exploring the rate of CUB evolution leaving us with no indication if we should expect differences in CUB between C-Left and the rest of the \kluyveri genome due to an introgression from a closely related species.
However, while it is conseivable that CUB has not differed betwen \kluyveri and the unknown donor organism despiete the large difference in GC content due to differences in amino acid usage, we considered it unlikey as it would reguire large scale systematic changes to the amino acid composition.

We formulated a hypothesis that we validated agains a null hypothesis. 
The alternative hypothesis H1 (Heterogenous Genome) assumed that the \kluyveri genome is comprised of two regions with distinct CUB, and therefore we expect to improve resulting model fits under this hypothesis. 
As null hypothesis H0 (Homogenous) served the assumption that there is no observable difference between C-Left and the rest of the \kluyveri genome, showing the same CUB across the whole genome.
We devided the \kluyveri genome in two parts, C-Left covering the introgressed region on the left arm of chromosome C and the rest of the \kluyveri genome \citep{payen2009}.
ROC-SEMPPER \citep{gilchrist2015}, a mechanistical model describing how mutation bias, selection for translation efficiency and protein synthesis rate effect observed codon usage was fitted, either with the whole data set (H0) or the split data set (H1).

\subsection*{Predicting Protein Synthesis Rate and Model Selection}
One of the advantages of using ROC-SEMPPER to analyze CUB over other tools like CAI \citep{sharp1987} is that it gives us to predict protein synthesis rate and does not require it as input.
We estimated the protein synthesis rate $\phi$ for each gene under both hypothesis, H0 and H1 (Figure \ref{fig:phi_corr_two_cond}). 
Under both hypothesis, estimated $\phi$ value show good agreement with observed gene expression data (H0: $\rho = 0.59$ to H1: $\rho = 0.69$).
However, we can observe interesting behaviour under H0.
First we note that the variation in $\phi$, $s_\phi$ is strongly reduced relative to the model fit under H1 (H0 : $s_{\phi}$ = 0.2 to H1 : $s_{\phi}$ = 1).. 
The reduction in $\sigma_\phi$, and the $\bar{\phi}$ value of one imposed by the model causes all $\phi$ values to cluster close to zero on the log scale. 
Essentially eliminating all variation in selection due to differences in $\phi$.
We also observe a separation of C-Left from the rest of the \kluyveri genome along $\phi$ with C-Left showing consitently lower $\phi$ estimates.
This separation between the two genomic regions by $\phi$ should lead to mutation bias being almost exclusively informed by genes located on C-Left while selection is purely informed by genes located along the rest of the genome.

To decide if we can reject the null hypothesis we compared the likelihoods obtained under both hypothesis.
H1 has 40 additional codon specific parameter (20 $\Delta M$, 20 $\Delta \eta$) describing mutation bias and selection for translation efficiency, and one additional $s_\phi$ term describing the variation in $\phi$ giving us 41 degrees of freedom.
The number of estimated $\phi$ parameters does not change as still only one $\phi$ value is estimated per gene and the number of genes under H0 and H1 remains unchanged.
We observed a $\Delta AIC$ of 81,504 allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and providing strong evidence that CUB differs between C-Left and the rest of the \kluyveri genome.

\subsection*{\kluyveri displays differential codon usage bias}
We find that the overall CUB observed under H0 is similar to the CUB observed in C-Left under H1 (Figure \ref{fig:cys_csp}).
In the case of the two codon amino acid cysteine (Cys), we observe that under H0 and H1 the $T$ ending codon TGT is the prefered codon.
Figure \ref{fig:cys_csp} shows how the proportion of the TGT codon changes with protein synthesis rate $\phi$.
Under H0, the proportion of TGT decreases with decreasing $\phi$, similar to the \kluyveri genome without C-Left under H1.
However, the preference under H0 switches from the $T$ ending codon TGT to the $C$ ending codon TGC for low $\phi$ values ($\log(\phi) < -0.1$).
The same switch of the prefered codon is observed in C-Left under H1.
However, no switch is observed in the \kluyveri genome without C-Left under H1, prefering the $T$ ending codon TGT across the whole spectrum of $\phi$.

The switch of the prefered codon under H0 is likely an artifact, caused by the separation of C-Left and the remaining genome by $\phi$. 
As previously stated, the separation of the genome along $\phi$ causes mutation bias $\Delta M$ to be purely informed by genes located on the introgressed region C-Left while the genes located on the remaining genome provide information on selection, $\Delta \eta$.
As selection favors the T ending codon TGT for both regions, C-Left and the remaing genome under H1, and mutation bias is mostly determined by genes located on C-Left it has become clear how a relative small region ($\sim$ 10\% of all genes) can drive the CUB observed when the heterogeneity in CUB is ignored.

\subsection*{Differences in mutation bias are greater than in selection bias}
The hypothesis best supported by the data allows us to attribute differences in GC-content mostly to mutation bias. 
A greater difference in mutational bias between the two genomic regions is revealed while selection for translation is mostly consistent between the two genomic regions. 
The comparison of the estimated mutation bias ($\Delta M$) resulted in strong disagreement in codons being favored by mutation ($\rho = -0.31$). 
Most codons that show a positive mutation bias in C-left are disfavored by mutation in the remainder of the genome.  
Furthermore, the strength of mutation bias is increased in C-left, reflected in the larger range of inferred $\Delta M$ values, revealing not only differences in mutation bias, but also showing that mutation bias in C-Left is stronger than in the rest of the genome. 
Estimates for $\Delta \eta$ showed a higher consistency between the two genomic regions ($\rho = 0.68$), indicating that - generally - the same codons are favored throughout the genome. 
The difference in time scale of protein synthesis rate $\phi$ between C-Left and Main, does not allow to draw any conclusions from the observed differences in range of the inferred $\Delta \eta$ parameter.

\subsection*{Comparing codon usage of various yeast species}
%Given low number of expected mutations, we expect to see high agreement between donor and C-Left
We determined the codon usage patterns of 38 related yeast species to explore if one of the species shows a similar codon usage pattern.
Agreement in codon usage patterns between C-Left and other yeast species would hint at a possible origin of C-Left.
We found that codon usage is conserved across most of the here analyzed yeast. 
Most yeast displayed high agreement in codon usage with the main part of the \textit{L. kluyveri} genome. Of the 38 analyzed yeast, 26 show a correlation $\rho > 0.5$ for the selection bias term $\Delta \eta$ and 32 for the mutation bias term $\Delta M$.
However, when we compared the codon usage of C-Left to the other yeast, we found only four showing a correlation $\rho > 0.5$ for $\Delta M$ but 25 yeast for $\Delta \eta$ (Figure~\ref{fig:csp_cor_all_yeast}).
Of the four yeast species with high agreement in mutation bias only three (\textit{C. albicans}, \textit{C. dubliniensis}, and \textit{E. gossypii}) also showed high agreement in selection bias.

\subsection*{GC content}
C-Left became of interest due to its remarkable difference in GC content compared to the rest of the \textit{L. kluyveri} genome.
\textit{L. kluyveri} shows a 13 \% increase in GC content strictly confined to C-Left. 
Previous work speculated that the origin of C-Left must be within the Lachancea clade since synteny can be found between C-Left, and \textit{L. thermotolerans} and \textit{L. waltii} (Payen et al 2009).
However, the Lachancea clade is not a monophyletic group.
The increased GC content in C-Left and the would therefore hint at a species closely related to \textit{L. kluyveri} with an elevated GC content. 
Our search identified only three closely related yeast with GC $> 50\%$ of which none is classified as a Lachancea (\textit{E. gossypii}, \textit{C. yegresii}, and \textit{S. musiva}).

\subsection*{Synteny between C-Left and other yeast genomes}

We evaluated genome synteny and rearrangements between several candidate genomes and \textit{L. kluyveri} C-Left using SynMap 4.2.
We were able to find further evidence of \textit{E. gossypii} as a potential origin for C-Left using genome synteny.
While synteny between \textit{L. kluyveri} and other Lachancea does occur, it is mostly limited to the main part of the genome.
Regions of synteny between C-Left and \textit{L. thermotolerans} and \textit{L. waltii} were previously reported (Payen et al. 2009) but disregarded as possible sources of origin due to their reduced GC content.

\subsection*{Rate of evolution of estimated parameters}
We used a phylogeny to estimate the rates at which $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta M$ evolves in our set of taxa. 
We then treated C-Left as a new species and determined the divergence time between C-Left and the rest of the \textit{L. kluyveri} genome.
The divergence time was estimated using the 40 $\Delta M$ parameters estimated to estimate 40 rates under brownian motion. 
A divergence time of 0.96 (CI: 0.79-1.22) expected mutations was estimated as the maximum likelihood time over all 40 rate estimates.
We used this divergence time as branch length estimate to determine the minimum age of the C-Left introgression based on the observed codon usage pattern.
This allowed us to determine the height in the tree for a possible attachment of C-Left to the phylogenetic tree.

The length of the C-Left branch corresponded well with the divergence time between our previously determined candidate XXX. 
We only employed $\Delta M$ in the rate estimation as we can assume that mutation bias does evolve neutral.
We can not make this assumption for $\Delta \eta$ as it represents the strength of selection relative to the strength of drift ($sN_e$).

\section*{Discussion}

We analyzed the codon usage bias of \textit{L. kluyveri} and found differing codon usage between two previously identified distinct regions of the genome. 
The two genomic regions were analyzed in conjunction and separate for differences in mutation and selection bias underlying codon usage patterns.
Our findings indicate that C-Left shows great differences in mutations bias, and small differences in selection bias.
These findings have implications for the study of codon usage beyond the here studied \textit{L. kluyveri} as such studies assume common codon usage across the genome.
Even though the authors are not aware of other organisms with such remarkable introgression patterns, other sources such as strand bias can lead to differences in mutation bias.
Differences in mutation bias or even selection bias can distort or bias the results of codon usage analysis. 
As the comparison of experimental expression data to predicted protein synthesis rate $\phi$ shows, prediction of $\phi$ is still reasonable when ignoring differences in codon usage bias. 
However, we can not assume this to be always true and our prediction of $\phi$ is greatly improved when separating C-Left from the rest of the genome.
We also note that the variation in predicted $\phi$ is greatly reduced and most values are found around zero when the genome is not split.
This causes the model to reduce the impact of extreme values in the codon usage spectrum, in this case caused by the strong disagreement in mutation bias $\Delta M$.

The evolution of codon usage is driven by three forces of evolution: mutation, selection and drift.
The insertion of a genomic region into a new host environment is expected to lead to adaptation in the inserted region.
Neutral change is slow as no selection is amplifying the proliferation of introduced changes.
We therefore, expect that differences in mutation bias, driving codon usage in low expression genes, to decay slower than differences in selection bias.
C-Left shows an access number of genes with low evolutionary mean expression.
The slow decay of mutation bias is supported by an excess of polymorphisms of low frequency, like expected under a model of neutral evolution (Friedrich 2014).

Attempts to elude on the unknown history of C-Left have been plenty full.
Here, we used the opportunity to see if the analysis of codon usage bias can be used to help elude on this question.
Our comparison of codon usage patterns across various yeast species revealed three promising candidate as origin of C-Left.
The first two \textit{C. albicans} and \textit{C. dubliniensis} show very low GC content compared to C-Left with 34 \% and 33 \% respectively. 
Furthermore, neither shows any synteny relationship with C-Left.
Therefore, depsite the low estimated divergence time between C-Left and these organisms, we have to disregard them as potential donor organisms. 
The third organism \textit{E. gossypii} however shows similar codon usage, GC content (52 \%), and high synteny.  


\section*{Materials \& Methods}

\subsection*{Model Selection}

\subsection*{Estimating codon usage bias}
We analyzed the coding genes of several yeast species (see Table \ref{org_overview}) using ROC-SEMPPER \citep{gilchrist2015} implemented in the R package AnaCoDa (Landerer et al. 2018).
In the case of \kluyveri we analyzed the codon usage pattern for the whole genome and separated C-Left from the rest of the genome for differential analysis of the codon usage patterns.
We compared the estimated codon specific parameters for mutation bias $\Delta M$ and selection bias $\Delta \eta$ for all yest species to the estimated $\Delta M$ and $\Delta \eta$ values of C-Left using Pearson correlation.
For \kluyveri we compared the two model fits for the whole genome and for the genome split using AIC as well as compared the estimated protein synthesis rates $\phi$ to observed gene expression data from XXX.

\subsection*{Estimating phylogenetic tree and divergence time}
To estimate the divergence time between \textit{L. kluyveri} and C-Left, we appropriated a dataset of several yeast species from Salichos and Rokas (2013). 
We decided to drop \textit{S. bayanus} from the tree as it is the result of a hybridization between \textit{S. eubayanus} and \textit{S. cerevisiae}.
We re-estimated the species tree by concatenation of all CDS found on the \textit{L kluyveri} main genome using RAxML (Stamatakis 2014) on the CIPRES Gateway (Miller et al. 2010).
We repeated the same process using only genes found on C-Left of \textit{L kluyveri}.
The divergence time was estimated by determining the rate of evolution $\sigma^2$ of the $\Delta M$ parameters estimated for each yeast species.
We only utilized $\Delta M$ and not $\Delta \eta$ as these values are reflecting the strength of selection $s$ relative to the effective population size $N_e$ and therefore can not be assumed to evolve neutral.
As the variance under a brownian motion diffusion process growth with time at a constant rate $\sigma^2$, we can calculate the variance of the diffusion process at any given time $\sigma^2_t$. 
We solved $\sigma^2_t = t\sigma^2$ for $t$ to find the combined maximum likelihood estimate for $t$ for all 40 rate estimates.
The confidence intervals for $t$ was obtained from the profile likelihood by calculating where the likelihood function drops by two units.
  
\subsection*{Genomes}
Coding sequences or the different yeast species used in this study where obtained from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, yeastgenome.org, and the European Nucleotide Archive. Incomplete, and duplicated sequences were removed before model fitting.

\subsection*{Determination of synteny}	
The complete genomes of several yeast species along the phylogeny were downloaded from the NCBI genome database.
Whole genome alignments where performed using SyMAP v4.2 (Soderlund et al. 2006, Soderlund et al. 2011).
We analyzed synteny relationships between C-Left and the genomes of several yeast species to understand where along the phylogenetic tree synteny breaks down.
