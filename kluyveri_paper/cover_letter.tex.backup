\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-authors, Dr.~ Brian C. O'Meara, Dr.~ Russel Zaretzki, Dr.~Michael Gilchrist, and myself, I would like to submit our article entitled ``Decomposing Mutation and Selection to Identify Mismatched Codon Usage'' for publication in \emph{Genome Biology and Evolution} as a \textbf{Research} article. 

Most studies on codon usage implicitly assume that the codon uage patterns of a genome is shaped by a single cellular environment. 
However, as species exchange genetic material, one would expect to see the influence of multiple cellular environments on a genomes codon usage pattern.
Given that transferred genes are likely to be less adapted than endogenous genes to their new cellular environment, we expect a greater genetic load of transferred genes if donor and recipient environment differ greatly in their selection bias, making such transfers less likely.
More practically, if differences in codon usage of transferred genes are unaccounted for, they may distort parameter estimates.

To illustrate these ideas, we analyze the CUB of the genome of \emph{Lachancea kluyveri}, the earliest diverging lineage of the Lachancea clade.

Thank you for your time in this matter.
We look forward to hearing from you regarding this submission.

\closing{Sincerly,}

\end{letter}
