\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}
Models exist on a spectrum from descriptive over phenomenological to mechanistic with increasing power to extract information from data.
Even when information about the underlying mechanism exists, transition towards mechanistic models is oftern slow.

Why building models?

\section{Mechanistic models extract information beyond the phenomenon they describe}

specific about cost/benefit
CAI and others do not account for differences in mutation/selection as cause for cub.
Example: CAI only gives me difference in CUB, not any of the additional information described in Ch3
Similar, I get fitness/selection and not just rates in Ch4

\section{Mechanistic models supplement experiments}

Extract information from experiemnts
Extrapolate from experiments?
Hypothesis for mechanism behind experimental results
