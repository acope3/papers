\chapter*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}
Mutation, selection, and drift are the three forces guiding evolution.

Interplay of forces is complicated.

Efficacy of one depends on the others, e.g. population mutation rate is $\mu N_e$, efficacy of selection is $sN_e$.

Using mechanistic models to separate effects.

Separation of mutation, and selection allows us to extract more information.
