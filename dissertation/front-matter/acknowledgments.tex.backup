\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I am greatfull for the many people at the University of Tennessee and in Knoxville that that made my time here such a pleasure.
First and foremost I want to thank my Adviser, Dr. Michael Gilchrist for his long lasting patience, his availability and his teachings;
always sharpening my focus and providing a new angle to a problem.
Great thanks also goes to my commitee Dr. Bejamin Fitzpatrick, Dr. Brian O'Meara, and Dr. Russel Zaretzki as they were always available for questions and discussions and for their great guidance.
In particular Brian O'Meara who always had an open door and tolerated my frequent visits.
None of the work presented in this dissertation would have been posssible without their great guidance.
I also have to thank the faculty and students in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, allowing me to broaden knowledge and insights with always stimulating discussions and for moral support.
Specially John Reese, Cassie Dresser and Jim Fordyce.
