\chapter*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}

Mathematical and statistical models are useful for describing and understanding observations in genetics and genomics.
Mathematical models have to constantly be updated to relfect current biologucal understanding.
Early models were largely descriptive and phenomenological, but mechanistic models allow for the extraction of more biologically relevant information. 
Mutation, selection, and drift are the three forces guiding evolution.
Mechanistic models allow us to separate and distinguish hoe these forces shape the observed data.
I demonstrate the usage of mechanistic models to relate protein coding sequences to their fitness landscapes and the evolutionary forces shaping it.
Using the yeast \textit{L. kluyveri}, I show the increased cost of protein synthesis due to a large scale inrogression with mismatched codon usage.
Furthermore, I analyze the site specific selection on amino amino acids in the $\beta$-lactamase protein TEM which confers antibiotic resistance in \textit{E. coli} and related species.
